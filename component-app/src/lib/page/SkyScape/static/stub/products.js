        'As winter transitions into the first fringes of spring along the midwest, the weather patterns shift, bringing intense thunderstorms as they roar along the prairies of the American plains. This is a great time to witness mesocyclonic and sculpted thunderstorms with incredible structure, lightning and color while being tutored on photographic composition, and atmospheric science. KEY NOTES Workshop I starts and ends in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Our clients will able to learn how to photograph storms in difficult light, and can elect to be educated on finding, tracking, and intercepting each storm with detailed radar programs during our storm chase workshop. Our unique specialized workshops educate and broaden and refine clients ability to creating beautiful high resolution and detailed imagery of thunderstorms while witnessing the grandscapes of the prairie skies, green fields and flowers to accent their composition. Our workshops are also very unique in educating for those that seek post-processing techniques when we have time between chase sessions to help create the art photography that clients seek. In addition to creating photographic memories, our workshop offers all levels of learning about the mechanics and science behind these sometimes violent beautiful weather phenomenons. Our team shows you not just how to chase thunderstorms, but how they are created while we storm chase. We look forward to spending time with you experiencing the thrill, adventure and amazing moments chasing light, structure and color during these storm chases on the great plains!',
