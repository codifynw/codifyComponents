  primary: `“We” are a small group of amateur Fine Art Landscape Photographers
    located in Denver, Colorado. By “we”, I mean “me”, and by small, I
    mean a group of 1. And when I say “Photographer”, what I really mean
    is that I’m actually an airline pilot who occasionally goes out and
    takes a few snapshots hoping that something pretty will get in the way
    of my lens.`,
  father: `My father, Hank Morgan, is a successful photojournalist, so I’ve always had cameras close by, but I never took the time to learn much about them.  It wasn’t until April, 2009, that I decided that I wanted to try my hand at landscape photography. Very quickly I became hooked and have been trying hard to hone my skills both in the field and in Photoshop to produce images that are pleasing.`,
  thank: `The greatest gift that photography has given me is the return to nature that I was definitely missing in my life. I have seen enough stunning scenes during my brief stint as a landscape photographer to last a lifetime, and hopefully my images will allow you to enjoy them with me.`
